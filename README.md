### Installation
- Head to the releases and download the one for your system operating system and architecture, if your one is missing then you'll have to compile it yourself
- Unzip the download into a folder
- In the .env file set your port, the default is 8080

### Adding Songs
- Create a folder called inputs (if it doesn't exist)
- Download your song as an MP3 file
- Put the mp3 file into the inputs folder
- Rename the file to the format: `Artist - Title.mp3`
- Start the program
- Wait until all songs are removed from the inputs folder (this may take a while)
